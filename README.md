# 🏀 Basketball Courts in Aarhus

## 📄 Overview

This project was my **final exam project in 2024** on Multimedia Design Programme in Business Academy Aarhus, for which I received a **perfect grade**.  

The goal was to create a digital solution around the theme **“Hidden Gems”**, and I chose to focus on **basketball courts in Aarhus**. As someone who has loved playing basketball since childhood, I was excited to design an application that helps players discover unique  courts in the city.  

## 🔍 Research & Process

This project was not only about coding, but about applying a **complete UX design process**:  

- **UX Research** – identifying the problem and opportunities  
- **Interviews & User Insights** – gathering feedback from potential users  
- **Methodology** – structured approach to concept development  
- **Final Report** – full documentation of the research and design process  

The **design and website** are the direct result of this research work.  

## 🚀 Features

- Map-based exploration of basketball courts in Aarhus  
- Highlighting “hidden gem” courts for players to discover  
- Court detail pages with information and visuals  
- Leaderboard concept to engage players and track visits  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript**  

⚠️ **Note:** When it came to the coding part, I relied on AI prompts to generate the code. While the implementation itself was AI-assisted, I’m proud of the final result and how it represents the research and design I worked hard on.  


## 🙌 Motivation

Basketball has always been a passion of mine, and this project allowed me to combine that passion with UX design and digital creation.  
Even though the coding was AI-generated, the **concept, research, and design** are fully my own work, and I’m proud of how the project turned out.
